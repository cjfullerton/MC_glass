Monte Carlo code I've used for studying various glassy systems.

Warning: needs some cleanup and testing!

Includes:
- Neighbour lists and cell lists
- NPT, NVT, swap integrators
- Various types of particle
- Various boundary condition options (periodic, hard, etc)
- Option for gravitational field
- Some code for analysing simulated trajectories
